Invasion (working title)
========================

You complete randomized missions to earn Resource Points (RP).

You accumulate these to unlock specific missions to prevent an Invasion
of your planet.

You also expend these in case you need to replace squad members, want to respec
equipment in the field or call in air support.

Missions also decrease probabilities for specific enemy types, for example:
* if you destroy pupae during certain missions you have less flying enemies later on
* if you destroy eggs before hatching you have less larvae
